                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p>
                    <b>The time is now</b>, and regional transit is coming. King County is creating a master plan for significant changes to their downtown campus, and the City of Seattle is working on multiple planning efforts following the COVID-19 pandemic. The time to support critical legacy communities is now, as well as identify ways to ensure strength and continuity ahead of the changes that will come.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This <b>effort is collaborative.</b> The development of the vision for the South Downtown is built on <a href="#">past planning</a> efforts and supported by the City of Seattle, King County, and Sound Transit, who are all working in partnership with the community to realize visions put forward by the community. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>This place is critical.</b> The South Downtown study goes beyond station areas. It is a comprehensive approach to the area, connecting and supporting the history and strength of the people and businesses that make these neighborhoods special.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>The community is key.</b> This is the opportunity for you to shape the future. This work serves the community first and will only be successful as a co-creation with our communities. With regional connections expanding, this area will change. The ideas and opportunities to protect, support, and grow the legacy that these communities hold will come best from within. The workshop series described below is the opportunity to leverage those ideas for better planning across the multiple agencies doing the work.  
                </p>

                <h4>Background</h4>
                <p>
                    The idea of a South Downtown Hub plan emerged from Sound Transit’s <a href="#">Further Studies</a> work for the <a href="#">Ballard Link Extension Project</a> in late 2022 into early 2023, during which the Chinatown-International District and Pioneer Square communities shared ideas and opportunities to improve the South Downtown area. In March 2023, the Sound Transit Board identified a preferred alternative in the CID. The Board also responded to the community’s South Downtown area feedback by giving Sound Transit direction to work with the City of Seattle, King County, and other potential partners to further develop South Downtown improvement ideas with the community and explore funding and partnership opportunities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sound Transit, King County, and the City of Seattle are continuing the partnership with the community through open office hours and a workshop series that looks at South Downtown cohesively. The series will support the visioning and prioritization of potential investments to streets and public spaces that help connect neighborhoods and regional transit modes, as well as explore opportunities to activate historic buildings and guide new development with community-serving uses. This work goes beyond station locations and takes a comprehensive look at the neighborhoods and how they connect. Sound Transit needs the community’s help to prioritize potential investments to the South Downtown area.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Final ideas and concepts will be compiled and prioritized into a cohesive plan that the project partners will endorse. This plan will include specific implementation strategies for projects and identify Sound Transit, the City of Seattle, King County, and potentially other project partners that can realize these projects.
                </p>

                <h4>Project partners</h4>
                <p>
                    Sound Transit, the City of Seattle, and King County are partnering with the community around the South Downtown Hub planning efforts. What role does each agency play in this work?
